# VQE-Molecular-Simulation
Implemented a Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) using Cirq and OpenFermion to simulate molecular ground-state energies. Designed quantum circuits, applied Jordan-Wigner transformations, optimized parameters with classical algorithms, and compared results to exact solutions to explore molecular potential energy surfaces.
